        <strong>Figure 1.</strong> The total estimated presences per day for all
          types of people in the city of Florence during the summer. We can see
          that on an average day, one third of the people in the city are
          tourists. That ratio increases in the month of August as foreign
          tourism remains somewhat constant, whereas the resident population
          makes a dip. We can also see cyclic activity that is likely due in
          part to reduced calling on weekends.

        <strong>Figure 2.</strong> The breakdown of the estimates for foreign
          presence. The breaks are done by region of the world, with the most
          common tourist countries (The United States, France, Germany, Spain,
          and China) plotted separately instead of aggregated into their region.
          This shows that peak visiting months are not the same for every country.
