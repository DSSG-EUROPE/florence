        Card Activation<br>
It is important to know when people activate their Firenzecards since the population of users visiting museums with the card will be higher on the days following an activation. Two of the most popular museums to first use a card are the Uffizi and the Accademia. Given that both of those museums are closed on Mondays, we see an expected surge of activations on Tuesday. This has broader implications for the types of people buying Firenzecards; since many users want to use their card to obtain priority entry at the top museums, people are less likely to want to use a Firenzecard if their trip to Florence includes a Monday. Additionally, this large surge in activations on Tuesdays can partially account for the lowered entry rates with the Firenzecard we see on Friday, Saturday, Sunday,   and   Monday   at   many   museums.
